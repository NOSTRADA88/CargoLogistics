Here we got a simple API for current website, it implements simple CRUD operations with database. 
For database i decided to choose MongoDB a non-SQL storage because I always use PostgreSQL in my projects 

As main web framework fiber was chosen. Good documentation and simple usage. 
Unfortunately, fiber doesn't provide Automatic API documentation for projects as FastAPI/Django does, that's why i set default swagger
